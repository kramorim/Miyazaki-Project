                The Wind Rises (Japanese: 風立ちぬ Hepburn: Kaze Tachinu) is a 2013 Japanese animated historical drama film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, animated by Studio Ghibli for the Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DY Media Partners, Walt Disney Japan, Subaru, Mitsubishi, Toho and KDDI and distributed by Toho. It was released on July 20, 2013, in Japan, and was released in North America on February 21, 2014 under Disney's adult movie brand Touchstone Pictures.
                <br><br>
                The Wind Rises is a fictionalized biopic of Jiro Horikoshi (1903–1982), designer of the Mitsubishi A5M fighter aircraft and its successor, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, used by the Empire of Japan during World War II. The film is adapted from Miyazaki's manga of the same name, which was in turn loosely based on both the 1937 novel The Wind Has Risen by Tatsuo Hori and the life of Jiro Horikoshi. It was the final film directed by Miyazaki before his retirement in September 2013. However, in 2017, Miyazaki announced he had come out of retirement to produce How Do You Live?. That film is expected to be ready in 2020 or 2021.

                The Wind Rises was the highest-grossing Japanese film in Japan in 2013. It won and was nominated for several awards, including nominations for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year.
